  <h1>EMERNET E.I.N.S - runtime</h1>
  <p>
    EMERNET E.I.N.S (Emergency Information Network System) was created to provide important information in case of a complete communication network failure.
    EMERNET provides information like important Telephone numbers, emergency news applications (ex. NINA) and emergency services (ex. shelter locations).
    All information provided is managed by the Open Source Community on GitHub and EMERNET-EINS.org.
    EMERNET is frequently updated to provide the latest information.

This repository serves the server executable. This Application does the setup process for you.
All you have to do is download a pre-built jar (or build it your self), upload it to a server and execute it.
After installing it successfully, you should have a fully working EMERNET E.I.N.S Instance hosted on your device.

<h2 align="center" id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

This server runtime only works on Linux devices! This runtime was originally intended to be deployed on something like a Raspberry Pi, something that is low powered and can be placed anywhere in the house.

**What you need**

* A Linux device (Raspberry Pi, anything else that runs Linux)
* An Internet connection to set it up (and get updates)
* A WiFi/Wired network where other devices can access the web pages served
* Installed JRE

<h2 align="center" id="install">Install</h2>

### Download the latest runtime

To start off, please head to the [releases page](https://github.com/emernet-eins/server/releases) and download a pre-built jar.

*If you dont trust us for some reason, feel free to download the latest released source code and build it your self.*

### Put the jar on your server

Next step is to upload the jar to the machine where EMERNET E.I.N.S should be deployed.

### Execute the runtime

To start, execure the runtime with root privileges.

Gain root access:

```bash
sudo -i
```

or

```bash
su
```

Launch the jar file

```bash
java -jar emernet-runtime_X.jar
```

The setup will start to install all the required packages, applications and websites to your device.

### What will be installed?

* Apache2
* zip
* unzip
* screen
* More coming soon ([Click here for more information](https://github.com/emernet-eins/server#concepts)) 

### What this setup does

* Downloads the latest version of [EMERNET E.I.N.S System](https://github.com/emernet-eins/system/)
* Install an (Apache) Web server
* Creates Apache Config
* Sets (fixes) the permissions
* Relaunches the runtime in a screen

### Finish

Now the EMERNET E.I.N.S runtime is deployed successfully.

After the setup finished, the runtime will be relaunched in a screen which you can access by using

```bash
screen -r emernet
```

The runtime will check for updates every 24 hours to provide the latest information.

<h2 align="center" id="updating">Updating</h2>

### Updating the server runtime
Currently, there is no automatic way for the runtime to update it self. We might add this as a feature in future releases.

So if you want to always have the latest runtime, please check back to the [releases page](https://github.com/emernet-eins/server/releases) over time to be up to date.


<h2 align="center" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

As mentioned above, EMERNET E.I.N.S is a system that provides emergency information in case of an emergency.

**What is being provided?**

* Important numbers for multiple countries
* Automatically updated files
* Direct call links

### Browser Compatibility

EMERNET E.I.N.S works in pretty much every browser. Even mobile browsers are able to use the links provided.

<h2 align="center" id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

### Intent and purpose

We created this project to provide the really important information everybody could need in an emergency. We know that there are enough other ways to get to his information, but we are planning big for this project.

### Future

We are planning to extend this project into a raspberry Pi only version, that even installs everything required for a WiFi hotspot, so everybody can access the information by just connecting to the open WiFi.

### Monetization

We are not really planning to monetize this project. The information provided is free to be viewed to everybody. However, if you would like to buy us a coffee, feel free to do so.


<h2 align="center" id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

**We want contributing to EMERNET E.I.N.S to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** Due to our project being split into multiple parts, there is more than one repository on our organization. However, feel free to take part in developing every single one of them if you'd like to.

Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on EMERNET, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:

* Documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes
* Spelling or grammar fixes
* README.md corrections or redesigns
* Adding features
* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.
* Spreading the word about EMERNET and helping someone else who needs help
* Teaching others how to contribute to our repos!
* Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about EMERNET E.I.N.S.

If you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to us by simply submitting an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!

_Looking to speak about EMERNET?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to emernet@rustige.me and we can give pointers or tips!!!

<h3 align="center" id="flavour">Creating your own flavours of EMERNET</h3>

If you'd like to have a different color, or just something else that does not meet your likings, feel free to do so and fork the repository.
